# ![Rust Logo](https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-32x32.png) Rust Learning Repository

I am a **NLP student at Paris Cité**, and this repository tracks my learning learning **Rust** through exercises on [Rustfinity](https://www.rustfinity.com/).  

This initiative complements my academic studies and helps me build practical skills aligned with the professional requirements of the NLP industry, where Rust is increasingly used for high-performance, safe, and concurrent systems.


## Repository Structure

- The repository provides a **chronological record** of my learning journey in Rust.
- Each exercise is in its own folder (Hello_world, Declaring_Variables, etc...) as a standalone Rust project with a main.rs file.
- Every folder contains a Cargo.toml and src/main.rs (cargo new --bin exercice), making it a self-contained Rust project that can be run with `cargo run`.



## Goals

- Gain proficiency in Rust syntax, concepts, and best practices.
- Build a demonstrable portfolio of applied exercises.
- Prepare for real-world, performance-sensitive NLP projects.
